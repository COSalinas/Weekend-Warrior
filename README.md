# _Weekend Warrior_

This project is meant for people to share fun and exciting weekend plans with others. If you want to share a fun idea or just find something for you and your friends to do, you can come here and see what's popular in your area.

We all have different things that we liked to do, hobbies that overlap. When talking about our hobbies we found that there was no place where one could go to talk about plans that spanned all of our different hobbies. So we wanted to make a place where you could share fun things around the area no matter what you’re into.

We have made a site where you can go share your ideas for biking, four wheeling, hiking, frisbee golf or even just grabbing a few beers with the boys. Others can then come and see what is popular in their area. They can either run with an existing idea or create their own.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5boilerplate)).

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

- Please **do not** open issues or pull requests regarding the code in
  [`.htaccess`](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache),
  [`jQuery`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/),
  [`Modernizr`](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) or
  [`Normalize.css`](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) (open them in
  their respective repositories).

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

   We have a long history of sometimes _very_ detailed discussion of every line of code
   in the project. We want discussion, so it might still warrant an issue. It
   just helps to get the (sometimes extensive) context.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test
   case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
